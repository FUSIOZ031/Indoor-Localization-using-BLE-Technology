# Indoor Localization using BLE Technology #

This project utilizes BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology and an ESP32 module to enable indoor localization. The system works by creating a network of BLE devices that can communicate with each other and a central MQTT server. The server can then use the data transmitted by the BLE devices to determine the location of devices within the network.
## Requirements ##

1. ESP32 module
2. BLE-enabled devices
3. MQTT server

## Installation ##

1. Install the necessary libraries for the ESP32 module to communicate with BLE devices and the MQTT server.
2. Set up the MQTT server and configure it to receive data from the ESP32 module.
3. Program the ESP32 module to scan for and connect to nearby BLE devices, and transmit data to the MQTT server.
4. Set up the BLE devices to be scanned by the ESP32 module and transmit their data.

## Usage ##

1. Turn on the ESP32 module and BLE devices.
2. The ESP32 module will begin scanning for and connecting to nearby BLE devices.
3. The MQTT server will receive data from the ESP32 module and the BLE devices, and use this data to determine the location of the devices within the network.

## Troubleshooting ##

* If the ESP32 module is not able to connect to the MQTT server, check the server configuration and ensure that it is properly set up to receive data from the ESP32 module.
* If the ESP32 module is not able to scan for or connect to BLE devices, check the device settings and ensure that they are properly configured to be scanned by the ESP32 module.
## Limitations ##

* The accuracy of the indoor localization system may be affected by the density and distribution of BLE devices within the network.
* The range of BLE technology is typically limited to about 30 meters, so the system may not be suitable for large or sprawling spaces.

## Future Work ##

* Increasing the number and density of BLE devices within the network could potentially improve the accuracy of the indoor localization system.
* Integrating other types of wireless technology, such as WiFi or ultrasonic, could potentially increase the range of the system and enable it to be used in larger spaces.
* Developing machine learning algorithms to analyze and interpret the data transmitted by the BLE devices and MQTT server could potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of the indoor localization system.    

## Conclusion ##

BLE technology and an ESP32 module can be used to build a system for indoor localization by creating a network of BLE devices that can communicate with each other and a central MQTT server. While the range of BLE technology may be limited, the system has the potential to be accurate and efficient for indoor localization in small to medium-sized spaces. By integrating additional wireless technologies and developing machine learning algorithms, the system could potentially be further improved and expanded for use in a wider variety of indoor environments.
